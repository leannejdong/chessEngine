# Prototyping a chess engine

## The plan to design a chess game for kids

1. Define the Chessboard

- Create a data structure to represent the chessboard. Use 2D array or a custom class to represent board and its pieces

2. Piece Representation

- Define classes to represent different chess pieces (pawn, rook, knight etc)
Each class should have methods for movement validation and a way to track their position on the board.

3. Player Management

- Create classes to represent the players. These classes should handle the logic for making moves, keeping track of captured pieces, and determining if the player is in check or checkmate

4. Move Validation

- Implement rules for each chess piece's valid moves. This include considering the current state of the board, ensuring moves don't put the player's king in check, and handling special moves like castling and en passant.

5. Game logic

- Create a class to manage the overall game logic. This class should handle things like checking for checkmate, stalemate, and draw condition. It track the game state.

6. User interface

- Implement a user interface if we want to play the game visually. One can use lib like SFML or SDL for this purpose

7. Input/Output

- Implement a way for players to input their moves and for the game to display the current board state. If we are building a text-based game, simple console I/O suffice.

8. Testing and debugging

- Test our game extensively to ensure it follows the rules of chess and handles all edge cases correctly. Debug issues that may arise.

9. Documemny and refactor

## Where does the game loop fit in?

The game loop is a continuous loop keeps the game running and performs several essential tasks, such as

1. Input handling
